              <p>
                <b>Frontend Development</b> is my passion. I love being able to
                combine design and development together to create websites that
                serve as both a functional element and a great design. I love
                working in this forever changing field and try to keep up to
                date with all the latest developments.
              </p>
              <p>
                My roots are in <b>Web & Graphic Design</b>. It is what sparked
                my interest for all things design and web related. I believe to
                be a great web developer you need to have a good understanding
                of design and the user experience. The art of combining this
                with smooth backend functionality is something that goes so
                unnoticed but can make all the difference.
              </p>
              <p>
                Over the past few years working as a developer I have been
                expanding my knowledge of <b>backend development</b> on the web.
                A lot of projects I have been involved in included server-side
                work and databases. I have also helped setting up data-structure
                and the the creation of CMS systems.
