                    At hairyLemon Digital I worked with a wide range of clients
                    to create their sites using multiple different frameworks
                    and CMSs. This was a fast-paced environment with many
                    projects on the go at the same time. It required quick
                    learning of new technologies that clients would bring to us
                    to take on. The majority of my role involved developing
                    sites within Shopify, WordPress and Statamic. I also worked
                    alongside a backend engineer to set up product applications
                    using Vue.js, Laravel and REST APIs.

                    In this role I was part of a larger team of developers that
                    worked on an online software for brand monitoring. The
                    product was a React/Redux/Rest API application with a Python
                    backend. My day-to-day tasks involved the implementation of
                    new features, developing unit testing, and transferring
                    legacy Python components into their new React framework.

                    In this position, I focused on building and updating client
                    websites. I worked on a range of different websites for
                    multiple different industries. Most of the sites were
                    vanilla Javascript or Angular based.

                    Redesign of the website for a business management company.
                    The original website was very out of date and restricted
                    potential clients from accessing information on the
                    business. I recreated the website into a responsive design
                    that could be easily accessed on all platforms.

                    a freelancer alongside a job working as a
                    waitress/bartender. I found multiple web projects through
                    networking and online freelancer websites. These projects
                    enhanced my skills in communication as a lot of the clients
                    were based overseas and could only be contacted through
                    email/phone.

                    Throughout my travels I would pick up small freelance jobs
                    while also working on the side in bars and restaurants. I
                    started out only doing web design projects but found a love
                    for coding, so during this time I also continued to enhance
                    my skills in front-end development.

                    During this time I picked up my first ever web

                    The work involved a redesign of the clients bridal gown
                    website. Working for Louise enhanced my communication skills
                    as I learnt how to listen and be understanding of others
                    opinions and ideas.

                    While I was studying at the polytechnic, I was chosen to
                    create peer support classes in DreamWeaver and web design. I
                    felt like my level of knowledge in DreamWeaver and HTML was
                    high enough to teach to first year students, however it also
                    encouraged me to keep learning myself so I could teach even
                    more.

                    Graphic Design, however in my final year I feel in love with
                    the web and began coding. Since graduating I followed my
